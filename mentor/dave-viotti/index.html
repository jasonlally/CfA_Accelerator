                <p>Rebecca Foster is an advisor for the Mayor’s Office of Innovation for the City and County of San
                    Francisco. Prior to her position at the Mayor’s Office, Rebecca worked as an investment banker in
                    the Public Sector & Infrastructure group at Goldman Sachs for eight years.</p>

                <p>Rebecca served as lead banker, project manager, or key team member on over $13 billion in lead
                    managed financings for state and city governments, universities, and public power entities. She led
                    the firm’s banking efforts for several Western states, and was responsible for developing and
                    executing business strategy and managing state coverage teams. Rebecca led and project-managed
                    transactions ranging from the State of Colorado’s successful $684M unemployment insurance financing
                    to UC Regents’ $1.2B working capital borrowing to address pension-related costs. She also managed
                    several debt and advisory related transactions with the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power as
                    they moved to reduce their carbon footprint. While in New York, she played a key role in developing
                    the relationship with Florida Citizens and the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund, subsequently
                    managing execution for over $6B of Florida’s debt issuance to prepare for hurricanes, including
                    placing $3.5B in bonds during financial crisis. As part of her efforts she worked with Florida’s
                    Governor and Treasurer to define best strategies to balance support of state’s economy by providing
                    hurricane insurance while also managing risk to state’s capital position.</p>

                <p>In 2008, Rebecca was selected for a one-year position as the Chief of Staff/Business Manager for the
                    national Public Sector & Infrastructure Department. In this role she managed changes to the
                    business’s structure and strategy around the financial crisis, handled day-to-day business
                    operations, fielded press inquiries, and developed and presented analyses on business strategy,
                    revenue growth, and organizational structure. She also managed staffing, reviews, and compensation
                    planning for over 30 team-members during a period of dramatic headcount reduction.</p>

                <p>Prior to Goldman, Rebecca worked in urban development, real-estate, and energy-related consulting at
                    HR&A Advisors. In her work at HR&A, she managed the public-private redevelopment effort of the
                    Anacostia and Southwest waterfronts in Washington, D.C., ran the energy-efficiency loan program for
                    the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, analyzed property tax code changes for
                    the Real Estate Board of New York, and worked on public-private park development projects from
                    Charlotte, North Carolina to Brooklyn, New York.</p>

                <p>As a Coro Fellow in New York City she reported for the Village Voice newspaper, developed a
                    field-communication strategy for the NYC Parks Department, and ran local operations for a New Jersey
                    congressional election, among other projects. During graduate school Rebecca worked at the White
                    House Office of Management and Budget focusing on urban development, and she started her career
                    spending six summers as a river guide on rivers throughout the Western US.</p>

                <p>Rebecca received her B.A. from Brown, earning Magna Cum Laude and Departmental honors for her thesis
                    and being elected to Phi Beta Kappa. At Brown she captained the nationally-ranked ultimate Frisbee
                    team and was a program coordinator at the Center for Public Service. Rebecca received her MBA from
                    Stanford, where she ran the Public Management Initiative, published a paper on the business impacts
                    of Climate Change, and was president of the Government and Politics club.</p>

                <p>Rebecca is a currently an active board member of the Mission Preparatory School, a K-8 charter school
                    serving some of San Francisco’s most underserved students, and ARTA, a non-profit whitewater rafting
                    organization. Over the last ten years she has run several marathons and triathlons. She loves to
                    explore the mountains, rivers, ocean, and San Francisco neighborhoods with her husband Doug and two
                    boys.</p>
