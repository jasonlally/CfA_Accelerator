                <h2>Why is the program unique?</h2>

                <p>Entrepreneurs get to work within San Francisco City Hall to develop solutions for actual, observed
                    pain
                    points and needs of the government. In addition, products and services that successfully solve
                    issues
                    faced by San Francisco can easily expand to addressing similar needs of other cities and states
                    across
                    the nation in addition to the private sector.</p>

                <h2>Who is the target entrepreneur?</h2>

                <p>We are looking particularly for entrepreneurial teams who recognize that challenge and opportunity go
                    hand-in-hand. It is also critical that the EIRs think about solving problems at a large scale. Pain
                    points and issues faced by government need products and services that can scale well and can
                    function
                    across multiple environments and across different types of users. And we want EIRs who think big! As
                    an
                    analogy, we’re looking for teams who instead of building an app that tells you when the train is
                    delayed, builds products or services that helps the trains run on time.
