                <p>Got questions? Here are some answers, and we'll keep adding to the list over time.
                    If your question isn't answered here, reach out via the <a href="#getinvolved">contact form

                <h2>Why is the program unique?</h2>

                <p>Entrepreneurs get to work directly with the City and County of San Francisco to develop solutions for actual pain points and needs of the government, the largest consumer of products and services in the nation. In addition, products and services that successfully solve issues faced by San Francisco can easily expand to addressing similar needs of other cities and states across the nation in addition to the private sector.</p>

                <h2>Who is the target entrepreneur?</h2>

                <p>We are looking particularly for entrepreneurial teams who recognize that challenge and opportunity go hand-in-hand. It is also critical that the EIRs think about solving problems at a large scale. Pain points and issues faced by government need technology enabled products and services that can scale well and can function across multiple environments and across different types of users. And we want EIRs who think big! As an analogy, we’re looking for teams who instead of building an app that tells you when the train is delayed, build a product that helps the trains run on time.
                </p>

                <h2>What is the the opportunity in San Francisco?</h2>

                <p>The City and County of San Francisco has an annual budget over $8 billion. It has more than 28,000 employees across more than 50 departments and agencies. As the innovation capital of the world, we offer a well-recognized platform to expand to other public sector buyers across the nation. For an interactive view of the city budget and related revenues and expenditures, <a href="http://openbook.sfgov.org/">visit
                        SFOpenBook</a>.
                </p>

                <h2>Does my team have to spend 16 weeks "embedded" in San Francisco?</h2>

                <p>It’s up to you. The program is set up to provide a four month runway for you to work with government on developing a product or service that meets the needs of a department or agency and can be applied more broadly. To that end, we work with you to establish a reasonable roadmap over that timeframe. This will vary by team. The best use of that time depends on your team's stage and needs. We want you to be successful and understand that if you're building a business, you'll have to be doing other things as well.
                </p>

                <h2>Is this a full-time or part-time commitment?</h2>

                <p>You have to be a full-time entrepreneur. However, your time commitment to the program is flexible depending on your needs and stage. We recognize that building a business requires having many demands on your time and we appreciate that. We will offer you a variety of resources and insights and it is up to you how much you’d like to benefit from them.</p>

                <h2>What you mean when you say the product or service has to self-sustaining?</h2>
                <p>We want you to develop a successful product or service that is valuable to government here in San Francisco and across other cities, states and at the federal level. We expect you to ramp up your business through competitive and compelling offerings that governments consider purchasing because it has a measurable impact such as increased revenue, lower costs or enhanced productivity. </p>

                <p>Lenny is a co-founder of McKinsey’s Public Sector Practice and a director (senior partner) in the
                    Washington DC and San Francisco offices. He works with state and local governments and is part of
                    the leadership team of the McKinsey Center for Government. Lenny led the Firm’s knowledge
                    development efforts overseeing the McKinsey Global Institute and the Firm's communications, which
                    includes the McKinsey Quarterly, and has served for a decade on the McKinsey Shareholder Council
                    (its board of directors). Since joining McKinsey in 1983, he has helped numerous public-sector,
                    nonprofit, and corporate clients address their most complex management challenges.</p>

                <p>Lenny’s areas of expertise include globalization, corporate social responsibility, economic
                    development, regulation, and education. Among other projects, he supported a government agency as it
                    prepared to implement a major piece of legislation; this work included the creation of tracking and
                    reporting tools, the formation of cross-agency teams to facilitate dialogue, and the design of a
                    senior-level organizational structure for managing implementation. Lenny also recently helped an
                    environmental nonprofit group create a five-year corporate strategy and a corresponding six-month
                    work plan and assisted a hospital chain in implementing a large-scale lean transformation
                    program.</p>
